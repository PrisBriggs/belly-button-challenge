## Homework Module 14 - Interactive Visualizations - Belly Button Challenge

In this assignment, there is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

In this project a horizontal bar chart was created  with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in each individual.
In addition, a bubble chart was created to display each sample.
A dropdown menu shows the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
Finally, a Gauge Chart was deveoped to plot the weekly washing frequency of each individual.

All the plots are automatically updated when a new sample is selected.

The app is deployed to GitHub Pages, which is a free static page hosting service. The webpage can be found at https://prisbriggs.github.io/belly-button-challenge/ .
The GitHub repository with all the files created in this challenge is available at https://github.com/PrisBriggs/belly-button-challenge.git .
